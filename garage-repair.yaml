    image: dxflrs/garage:v2.1.0  # Matches your cluster version
    command: ["/garage"]  # Or just ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"] if /garage isn't the binary path – but it should work as a no-op
    args: ["--help"]     # Optional: runs a harmless command; remove if you just want it idle
    # If the above exits immediately, use this instead to keep it running indefinitely without sleep:
    # command: ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]  # tail usually exists in minimal images; if not, try ["/garage", "status"] in a loop via exec
